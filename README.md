# Mad Max Portfolio

## Description

This website was built to show my usage of building a custom website in react. I will continue to improve and revise this website as I learn more about react but at the time of creation I am still very new and unfamiliar to it. Due to some complications I was having with the react sub repo, I had to make another repository and inserted all of my code into this repo. So I included both links for both repos.
